LJTableViewTextFields
=====================

An opensource project to demo how I add different type of Keyboards, UIPickerView, UIDatePicker to UITextField which is contained in UITableViewCell; In the meantime, how the "Previous", "Next" and "Done" BarButtonItems, which are contained in UIToolbar, are used to handle the user interaction.

Two approachs have been used to handle the "Previous" and "Next" action, which are illusated in "SingleSectionTableViewController" and "MultipleSectionsTableViewController" respectively. 

Let me know if you have better solution.
